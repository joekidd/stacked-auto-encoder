"""
    Implementation of the preprocessing for the horse racing data.

    The scripts gets rid of unneeded features and converts textual features
    into numerical features, so that the neural network can operate on it.

    Please notice that I have absolutely no clue about horse racing and all
    this operations are based more on intuition and logical thinking rather
    than on horse racing knowledge.
